# ReactionTimeTester
A basic Python Script showing a finished time tester program that measures an individuals reaction time.
This script shows my basic understanding of the fundamentals of python with room for improvement.

# Breakdown on how it works
1. Asks the user to input a total number of rounds
2. Establish a function and empty lists to be used called later in the program
3. Initialise and implement the actual game logic
4. Calculate and store the results
5. Display results in a table format

# Future improvements
1. More innovative and presentable table format
2. Provide a leaderboard
